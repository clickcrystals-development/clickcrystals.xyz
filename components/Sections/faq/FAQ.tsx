    question: "Why is ClickCrystals banned on Modrinth?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The ClickCrystals project is <b>withheld, not banned</b> on Modrinth due to concerns regarding potential unfair advantages it may provide. This is not a ban, but a precautionary measure.

    question: "Why is my game crashing?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Crashes may occur due to <b>incompatibility issues</b>. Previous versions of ClickCrystals included a feature called Discord RPC, which displayed your activities on Discord. This feature, however, was only supported on Linux and Windows, leading to incompatibility with macOS and PojavLauncher
        <br /><br />To fix this, either get the new version of ClickCrystals, where we removed Discord RPC or get off Mac/PojavLauncher and get a real PC.

    question: "Is ClickCrystals safe? Is it a virus?",
    answer: (
      <>
        In May 2023, a counterfeit version of ClickCrystals was created and distributed by an individual using the alias <b>L0rax</b> (also known as Niksa_). This version contained malicious code designed to steal your Microsoft account details, Skyblock information, and IP address via a Discord webhook. After a concerted effort of months, the malicious version was removed, the webhook was destroyed and the issue was resolved.
        <br /><br />Only download ClickCrystals from official links provided on our website. Avoid downloading files from untrusted sources or accepting files from unknown individuals.

    question: "What is CCS, and how do I use it?",
    answer: (
      <>
        CCS (ClickCrystals Script) is an in-game tool that allows you to create custom modules. It functions similarly to creating datapacks, enabling a high level of customization within the game.

    question: "Is using ClickCrystals considered cheating?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Short answer: No.
        <br /><br />
        Long answer: ClickCrystals is not a cheat, it does not automate any task; every action requires direct player input. The mod itself does not provide any inherent unfair advantages unless the user creates a macro using the ClickCrystals script.

  {
    question: "Could I be banned for using ClickCrystals?",
    answer: (
      <>
        While ClickCrystals is designed to avoid providing unfair gameplay advantages, some servers may still ban players for using it.<br /><br />
        To minimize the risk:<br />
        - The mod is designed not to trigger anti-cheat systems.<br />
        - It appears as normal gameplay in third-person view.<br />
        - It maintains its logs separately from the vanilla logs (except error traces), which can be deleted if necessary.<br /><br />
        Important: Ensure you are using the latest version of ClickCrystals, as older versions included a command (!cc -users) that could be exploited to ban players.

    question: "How do I access the ClickCrystals menu?",

        By pressing the apostrophe key. If you don&apos;t know what it is, you&apos;re a third grader that shouldn&apos;t be play games and should be studying instead.
